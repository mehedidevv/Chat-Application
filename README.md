# Chat Application

This project presents a Chat Application developed using Kotlin, enabling real-time communication between users. The app integrates features like text messaging leveraging Firebase for real-time database synchronization and authentication. Key functionalities include secure user login, typing indicators, and push notifications for instant messaging. The application uses Kotlinâ€™s coroutines for efficient asynchronous operations and follows the MVVM architecture to maintain a clean, scalable codebase. Kotlin's concise syntax and safety features make it an ideal choice for developing a fast, reliable, and user-friendly chat application on Android platforms.


## Features

- Real-time messaging: Users can send and receive messages in real-time.
- Firebase Firestore: Data storage is handled by Firebase Firestore, providing a secure and fast way to store and retrieve data.
- Firebase Cloud Messaging: Notifications are handled by Firebase Cloud Messaging, allowing users to receive notifications even when the app is not open.
- MVVM architecture: The app follows the Model-View-ViewModel architecture, making it easy to maintain and scale.
- Coroutines: Coroutines are used for managing background tasks and managing the flow of data, making the app more efficient.
- Dagger Hilt: Dependency injection is handled by Dagger Hilt, making it easy to manage dependencies and improve testability.

## Technologies Used
- Kotlin: Primary language for app development.
- XML Layouts: For building responsive UI.
- Coroutines: For managing background tasks and asynchronous operations.
- Glide: Image loading and caching.
- Material Design Components: For building a modern UI.
Backend
- Firebase Realtime Database: For real-time message synchronization.
- Firebase Authentication: For user login and registration (email-password, Google, etc.).
- Firebase Cloud Storage: For storing shared media files (images, audio).
- Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM): For push notifications.
- Firebase Firestore (Optional): An alternative to Realtime Database for improved querying
## Uses
- Open the app and sign in/ sign up
- Send and receive messages in real-time
- Receive notifications even when the app is not open
